# Zep MCP Server: Unified Agent Memory Platform
## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Author:** AI Development Team  
**Status:** Draft  

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### Vision Statement
Create the first Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Zep Cloud that enables seamless, persistent memory sharing across all AI agents and platforms, establishing a unified memory layer that follows users everywhere they interact with AI.

### Project Goals
- Build a production-ready MCP server that integrates with Zep Cloud's memory platform
- Enable cross-platform agent memory continuity between Claude Desktop, Cursor, and other MCP clients
- Provide a robust, scalable solution for persistent AI agent memory
- Establish the gold standard for agent memory management in the MCP ecosystem

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points
1. **Memory Fragmentation**: Each AI platform (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.) maintains separate conversation contexts
2. **Context Loss**: Switching between platforms results in complete loss of conversation history and learned preferences
3. **Inefficient Workflows**: Users must repeatedly explain project context, preferences, and requirements to different AI agents
4. **No Learning Persistence**: Agents cannot build on previous interactions or accumulate long-term knowledge about users
5. **Missing Integration**: Despite Zep Cloud's powerful memory capabilities, no MCP server exists to leverage it

### Market Opportunity
- Growing adoption of MCP protocol across AI development tools
- Increasing demand for persistent agent memory solutions
- No existing MCP servers for Zep Cloud platform (first-mover advantage)
- Strong demand from developers using multiple AI coding assistants

---

## 3. Target Users

### Primary Users
- **AI-Powered Developers**: Professionals using multiple AI coding assistants (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.)
- **Teams Building AI Agents**: Development teams requiring persistent memory for their AI applications

- **AI Researchers**: Teams experimenting with long-term memory in AI applications
- **Platform Integrators**: Developers building on top of MCP protocol

### User Personas

#### "Sarah the Full-Stack Developer"
