# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement RAG strategy selection system
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build the system for selecting and configuring different RAG processing strategies
# Details:
- Implement contextual embeddings option (slower, higher accuracy)
- Add hybrid search capability (vector + keyword search)
- Build agentic RAG for code example extraction
- Implement cross-encoder reranking for improved relevance
- Create preview mode to show sample chunks before full processing
- Add batch processing functionality for multiple URLs
- Build configuration interface for strategy selection

# Test Strategy:
Test each RAG strategy independently and verify they process content correctly
