# Task ID: 10
# Title: Optimize performance and implement caching
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement performance optimizations to meet response time targets
# Details:
- Add caching layer (Redis or in-memory) for frequent queries
- Implement query optimization and database indexing
- Add streaming processing for large documents to prevent memory issues
- Implement exponential backoff and queue management for API rate limits
- Optimize vector search performance with proper indexing
- Add connection pooling and resource management
- Implement performance monitoring and alerting

# Test Strategy:
Verify all performance targets are met: <2s page load, <3s search queries, >95% uptime
